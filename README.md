I worked on this project as part of the NLP course taught at Dal by Dr. Vlado Keselj. It was my first sem here in Canada as well. This project opened a lot of doors for me.

I used Named Entity Recognition (NER) trained with full shark taxonomy on CITES global wildlife trade dataset to find out top reasons for sharks being endangered species. I care a lot about animals in general and this was an effort to spread awareness to save these innocent life forms.
Further details can be found on the presentation attached.
